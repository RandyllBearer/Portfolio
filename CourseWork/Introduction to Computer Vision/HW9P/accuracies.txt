- Unfortunately I never completed HW7, so I don't really have any results to compare to, so instead
  I will try to just provide analysis for how these results (listed below) matched up with my expectations.

- fc6 had a 91.667% accuracy and fc7 had a 92.333% accuracy, both of these seem higher than I expected,
  even when accounting for the fact that we used a pre-trained CNN.
