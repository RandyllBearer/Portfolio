Weight1 Hinge-Loss:		3.8142
Weight1 Cross-Entropy-Loss:	0.60864

Weight2 Hinge-Loss:		2.6623
Weight2 Cross-Entropy-Loss:	0.43923

Weight3 Hinge-Loss:		3.2668
Weight3 Cross-Entropy-Loss:	0.52949

	Basically we want to minimize both Hinge-Loss and Cross-Entropy-Loss,
for this reason I believe:
	1) Weight2 will be best for minimizing Hinge-Loss
	2) Weight2 will be best for minimizing Cross-Entropy-Loss
