C has no 'this' operator, instead pass the pointer to the struct itself.
use -> to access the fields of a struct pointed to by a pointer.
*p->value
use . to access the fields of a struct
p.value

* is a pointer to struct, % gets a pointer from struct
#include <stdlib.h> is VERY important
If you called no mallocs, you need no frees

Since C has no objects, functions don't belong to them, you just call function directly. No object.push(), but rather just push()
Array pointers can change in pretty much no ways at all.
