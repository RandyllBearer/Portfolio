Additional comments to the grader:

- I researched into the updated time complexity of .substring() and feel like I have a decent
understanding of the issue, but for the life of me I could not find a constant time way. I originally
attempted to use a StringBuilder() and just replace the consumed characters with an "" empty string but it didn't
make any noticeable performance increase so I just stuck with .substring().

- In "Monitor" mode, I do as instructed in the READ_ME file and to my knowledge implement the calculation of ratios correctly.
As for resetting the dictionary upon passing the threshold of 1.1 for the ratio of ratios, I completely reset all of my fields to default.
This means that the "old" value is updated to be the last "current" value each time the codebook is reset.  This wasn't explicitly instructed in the READ_ME but 
seemed like the best choice.
