#Co-Op with YelpNoWait

The University of Pittsburgh requires that all students complete a "Capstone Project". These are detailed, larger-scope projects with departamental heads or affiliated businesses. These projects are to be completed in groups of students, in communication and co-operation with a team of employees in said affiliate business.

My group was comprised of two other fellow students, and we worked in constant contact with the team at NoWait/Yelp. This project ran the length of a semester and was a good experience in a more professional rather than academic environment.

I lead multiple group round-table discussions concerning which voice-software and platform to use, presented multiple presentations on the status of our project, and helped code on the project itself.

For this project we used the Google's Dialogflow framework to create a proof-of-concept voice-only Yelp navigation application for the Google Home.
