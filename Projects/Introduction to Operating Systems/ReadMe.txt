#Introduction to Operating Systems

This folder contains three projects I completed for my Introduction to Operating Systems course, which covered the C programming language and how the Operating Systems interact with both physical and virtual hardware. These projects were completed individually.

Project 1: A driver/library combination which could utilize commands to 'draw' on the monitor.

Project 2: Unable to be shared due to University Policies.

Project 3: A zip compressor/decompressor algorithm.

Project 4: To be used in conjunction with a proprietary virtual machine. To sum the project up, I was tasked to create on a virtual machine a manual implementation of data storage in a tree network. File size limitations, subdirectory linking, and general data structure principles had to be taken into account.
