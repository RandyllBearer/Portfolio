#Dungeons Under Djinison

-----------------------



This will be my attempt at programming a rudimentary roguelike game (Dwarf Fortress this will not be) based off the 
campaign setting
of my friend's D&D Campaign.

This game will allow the player to take control of an intrepid adventurer who 
seeks his fortunes in the dungeons beneath the massive
desert metropolis of Djinison in the Sultanate of Al Lirraz. The 
player will battle monsters, level up, and collect magical items
as he or she descends floors further and further below the 
city. There is no end to the depths of the dungeon (Or is there?), and upon
character death the player will recieve a final 
score. Goal of the game is to naturally get as high a score as possible. There will be
multiple races, classes, and monster 
types.



This game will be programmed in Java with the initial plan being to implement it through ASCII graphics (Maybe Swing at a 
later date
but I'm no artist). The game will implement path-finding algorithms to control monster AI and hopefully be a 
fairly comprehensive example
of the basics of programming. The game will be developed to embody Model-View-Controller
architecture and utilize JUnit unit testing.
