#Projects

This folder contains various larger projects that I have worked on either for coursework, co-ops, or privately. These projects tend to be larger in scope than what I have uploaded to /Practice/, and contains the most significant assignments from /Coursework/.

I have determined these as Projects by relative scope compared to other assignments in that class. For example, the two projects in /Introduction to Python/ are rather basic as it was the first programming course I ever took, but compared to the other assignments in that class they were somewhat significat. Additionally, I uploaded NO files from /Introduction to Computer Vision/, as the scope of assignments in that class were rather equal, even though each of those assignments were much larger in scope than anything from /Introduction to Python/. For a more comprehensive overview of my portfolio, please do not consider only this /Projects/ folder.

The /Co-Op With YelpNoWait/ folder contains the resultant programs and documentation created during my time there.

The /Pawprints-Interface Design Methodology and Rapid Prototyping/ folder contains the sizable proof of concept android application my group made, as well as all documentation.
