#Intermediate Java

Contains the two main projects (not assignments) completed for my Intermediate Java course, created using the Netbeans IDE as per course requirements.

Project 1 is a basic, text ui general store simulator.

Project 2 was left to each student's individual choice, I chose to program a two-player text ui Chess Game, complete with possible move display. This was my second programing class, and as such did not fully embrace the reusability of functions. As a result, this program works perfectly fine but contains far more lines of repeating code than it should.
