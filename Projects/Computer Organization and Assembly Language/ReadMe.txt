#Computer Organization and Assembly Language

This folder contains the two projects I completed for my Computer Organization and Assembly Language course, which taught the underlying principles of Computer Hardware and how to code on the machine level with Assembly Language MIPS32.

Project 1 contains an encoder which displays and converts Assembly Code to Machine Code.

Project 2 contains a basic processor (capable of instructions per the course's specifications) simulated in Logisim.
